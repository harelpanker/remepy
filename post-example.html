              <strong>
                Good nutrition plays an important role in supporting your body’s
                natural recovery processes.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>

            <h2>Protein – Your Recovery Building Block</h2>
            <p>
              Protein has the ability to support the body’s natural repair and
              maintenance functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              After surgery, your body may need slightly more protein to help
              maintain muscle and strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aiming for balanced meals that include both protein and enough
              calories can support nourishment.
